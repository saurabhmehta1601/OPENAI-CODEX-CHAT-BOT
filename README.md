# AI BUDDY

## 1. Introduction

AI BUDDY is a web app where you can have chat with a super intelligent AI chat bot using the most capable GPT-3 model text-davinci-003 model by OpenAI.

## 2. How it works

### 2.1 Frontend

- The frontend for the web app is powered by [ Reactjs ](https://reactjs.org/).
- The react starter project for this project is generated by [ Vite ](https://vitejs.dev/) - an amazingly fast tool for creating frontend developement environment .

- The site is styled with [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) - A utility first CSS framework .
- The frontend is deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/dashboard) .

### 2.2 Backend

- It is written in [ Nodejs ](https://nodejs.org/en/) programming language with [AWS Lambda](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/index.html) - a serverless compute service and [AWS API Gateway](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/welcome.html) - a service to create web APIs.
- The resquest sent to `API Gateway` invokes the `Lambda function` which then makes an API call to fetch autocompletion from [OpenAI Api](https://openai.com/api/) and sends the recieved response to frontend .
- The Lambda function communicates with [GPT-3 model text-davinci-003](https://beta.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-3)
  with the help of [OpenAI Nodejs SDK ](https://www.npmjs.com/package/openai) to OpenAI Api .

## 3. Background

### 3.1 OpenAI API

The OpenAI API can be applied to virtually any task that involves understanding or generating natural language or code. We offer a spectrum of models with different levels of power suitable for different tasks, as well as the ability to fine-tune your own custom models. These models can be used for everything from content generation to semantic search and classification

### 3.2 ChatGPT

It is set of models that can understand and generate natural language . The main GPT-3 models are meant to be used with the text completion endpoint.

### 3.3 GPT-3 model text-davinci-003

It is most capable GPT-3 model. Can do any task the other GTP-3 models can do, often with higher quality, longer output and better instruction-following. Also supports inserting completions within text.

### 3.3 AWS Lambda

AWS Lambda is a compute service that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers. AWS Lambda executes your code only when needed and scales automatically, from a few requests per day to thousands per second. You pay only for the compute time you consume - there is no charge when your code is not running.
